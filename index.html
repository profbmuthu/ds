<li>Myth About Big Data - With Big Data, We’ve Moved into a New Era of Analytics</li>
<li>Big data is data that exceeds the processing capacity of traditional database systems. 
– The data doesn’t fit the gloves of traditional database architectures
– The data is too big and moves too fast </li>
<li>Big Data does not only relate to the size of data</li>
<li>Its about triggering an offer while a shopper is standing on a checkout line</li>
<li>Its about placing an ad on a website while someone is reading a specific article. </li>
<li>It’s about combining and analyzing data so you can take the right action, at the right time, and at the right place.</li>

<ul>
<li>Velocity: Moves at very high rates (think sensor-driven systems); Valuable in its temporal, high velocity state</li>
<li>Volume: Fast-moving data creates massive historical archives; Valuable for mining patterns, trends and relationships</li>

    <h2>What is Velocity ?</h2>

  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li><p>A conventional understanding of velocity typically considers how quickly the data is arriving and stored, and its associated rates of retrieval.</p></li>
<li><p>Two aspects to velocity, 
– one representing the throughput of data 
– the other representing latency</p></li>

<li><p>Throughput is data moving in the pipes. 
– Global mobile data is growing at a 78 percent compounded growth rate and is expected to reach 10.8 exabytes per month in 2016 as consumers share more pictures and videos. 
– To analyze this data, the corporate analytics infrastructure is seeking bigger pipes and massively parallel processing</p></li>

    <p>From transactions to observations
What is the use of big data?</p>

<ul>
<li>The value of big data to an organization falls into two categories: 
– Analytical use: analytics can reveal insights hidden previously by data too costly to process, such as peer influence among customers, revealed by analyzing shoppers’ transactions and social and geographical data. 
– Enabling new products: by combining a large number of signals from a user’s actions and those of their friends, Facebook has been able to craft a highly personalized user experience and create a new kind of advertising business</li>

<li>First, data quality remains an issue. 
– The more data you accumulate, the harder it is to keep everything consistent and correct. </li>
<li>Second, adequate data characterization (metadata to the geeks) is critical. 
– How you deal with data -- even how you choose to organize its storage -- requires you to know how much data there is going to be and how fast it&#39;s likely to grow and change. A query that runs well to find 100 rows in a million-row table may not run well on 100 billion rows. </li>

<li>Third, interpretation remains more of an art than a science. 
– Software developers have had to design efficient filters and pattern recognizers that can sift through mountains of data and find (perhaps unanticipated) patterns that are relevant to a dimension of interest.</li>
<li>Fourth, data visualization -- representing results in an easily consumable form -- is critical. 
– What good is all that data if you can&#39;t understand what the interpreters--human or software--concluded from their analysis. </li>

<li>Fifth, you&#39;re generally going to have to choose 
– between a real-time view of the data (which may mean that you have to continuously recompute everything whenever the data changes) and a complete but retrospective view which will always be somewhat out of date.</li>
<li>Sixth, how do you know in advance how long the data is relevant or valuable? 
– Data costs money to acquire, store, analyze and back up. A retention policy beyond a typical &quot;keep everything forever&quot; approach is needed, and that policy has to be enforced.</li>

  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Big Data solutions are ideal 
– for analyzing not only raw structured data, but semistructured and unstructured data from a wide variety of sources.
– when all, or most, of the data needs to be analyzed versus a sample of the data; or a sampling of data isn’t nearly as effective as a larger set of data from which to derive analysis.
– for iterative and exploratory analysis when business measures on data are not predetermined.</li>

  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>The practice of analytics involves applying science and computing technology to vast amounts of raw data to yield valuable insights, and the “analytics” label covers a wide array of applications, tools, and techniques.</li>
<li>Predictive analytics, in-database analytics, advanced analytics, web analytics etc are collectively called as analytical workload.
What is an analytical workload?</li>
<li>Most interested parties can answer this question, more or less correctly, in a general way: “heavy statistical processing,” “lots of complex queries,” and so on</li>
<li>Analytics processing is characterized by fewer users (business analysts rather than customers and POS operators) submitting fewer requests, but queries can be very complex and resourceintensive. </li>

– Extreme data volume
– Data model complexity
– Variable and unpredictable traversal paths, patterns, and frequencies
– Set-oriented processing and bulk operations
– Multi-step, multi-touch analysis algorithms
– Complex computation
– Temporary or intermediate staging of data
